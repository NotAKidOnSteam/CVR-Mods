## Special Thanks
Honestly, a big thank you to the entire CVR staff for being so supportive and nice. I love you guys <3.

## DiscordMute
**This mod is a rewritten and adapted version of [Rafacasari](https://github.com/Rafacasari)'s code. It helped a lot.** </br>
**Here if you wanna check it: [DiscordMute](https://github.com/Rafacasari/DiscordMute)**

**Planned features (Implementation still ongoing):**
* Configurable mute key bind;
* UI button to mute/unmute;

## CVRConsoleViewer
**This mod has been made together with [PennyBunny](https://github.com/PennyBunny), and so we decided to keep it on her repository.** </br>
**For now, go check it: [CVRConsoleViewer](https://github.com/PennyBunny/CVRMods/tree/main/CVRConsoleViewer)** 

**Current features:**
* Adds an in-game Melon Console (located on the QuickMenu);
* Configurable font size;
* Configurable time stamp on/off;
* Configurable auto scrolling on/off;
* Configurable line limit (before it starts discarding older ones);

## ThirdPerson
Funni 3rd person mod, but standalone :3

**Current features:**
* Allows you to go into third person view by pressing Ctrl + T;
* Multiple view modes, Ctrl + Y to change between them;
* Will temporarily deactivate when opening menus so it doesn't get in your way.

## TrackingRotator
Same old mod that y'all already used from VRC. Currently working on it <3

**Current features:**
* This mod lets you rotate your tracking, it was made for situations like when you just wanna play while laying down, for example;
* You can change the rotation value, high precision value and "Reset rotation when a new world loads" on Melon Preferences.

## Installation
**Before installing:**

You will need to install [MelonLoader](https://discord.gg/2Wn3N2P) (discord link, see \#how-to-install), tutorials are also available in CVRMG. </br>
All the dependencies that might be necessary for each mod are also necessary.
After that, drop the mods' .dll files in the `Mods` folder in your game's directory.
